## 💻 About Me

I am an Agricultural Engineer and researcher focused on modeling evapotranspiration, remote sensing, and meteorological data analysis. I develop computational solutions to optimize water use in agriculture by combining satellite data, machine learning, and climate time series.

## 📦 Featured Projects

### 🔹 [BrazilMet](https://github.com/FilgueirasR/BrazilMet)

An R package to download and process data from INMET's Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) in Brazil, with a focus on estimating reference evapotranspiration (ETo). Available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=BrazilMet).

### 🔹 [CropDemand](https://github.com/FilgueirasR/cropDemand)

A R package for performing crop water balance analyses based on the Thornthwaite and Mather (1955) methodology. The cropDemand package allows customization of the available water capacity (AWC) parameter to reflect different crop requirements, and supports applications across all regions of Brazil. It integrates TerraClimate data (http://www.climatologylab.org/terraclimate.html). Available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=cropDemand).

### 🔹 [CropZoning](https://github.com/FilgueirasR/cropZoning)

An R package that enables climate-based crop zoning in Brazil by analyzing air temperature patterns using TerraClimate data. Available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=cropZoning).
